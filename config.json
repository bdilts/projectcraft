{"server":{"name":"Hegar SMP","description":"Welcome to Hegar SMP\nHegar SMP is an SMP started on November 3rd 8:15 P.M GMT and is focused around building a world connected through lore. Everything that is build has to fit in with the lore and has to look good of course. To rise our building potential we share everything like items and farms. Personal bases are so 2018. Communism is the new cool. Eventually we want to create an epic world together with an epic story behind it. Think game of thrones or Lord of the Rings but in Minecraft. But we're also here to create friends and teach each other to become better builders\n\n\nWe try to stay as close to the vanilla experience but do have some quality of life and texture changes. These include:\nServer:\nWe installed paperspigot for grief protection plug-ins and better performance\nDatapacks:\n2 shulker shells per shulker\/Dragon drops elytra\nmore mob heads\ndurability ping\nmultiplayer sleep\nextended blast furnace and smoker capabilities\ncustomizable armor stands\ncreepers don't do damage to blocks but do still damage players by turning off mobgrieving whenever a player comes within 6 blocks of a creeper so other types of mobgrieving required for farms still work.\n\nTexture changes:\npetrified oak slabs look like course dirt slabs with a crafting recipe added as well\nbirch leaves are orange\npaintings have changed to either look better or add things like tool racks\ndiorite is retextured to marble\nnote blocks look like crates\nend stone colour matches sandstone better\nblocks transition better into each other\n\nMisc\nfast travel is possible with command blocks at certain points (you can't just travel where ever you want)\nfire tick is off\n\nstuk met alle projecten die gepland staan, onder construction zijn en af zijn.\n\/nJoining is possible by messaging either JarPlayGo or Eelek through discord: JarPlayGo#9716 or Eelek#3702","members":[["JarPlayGo","ae85b6138de8483ab9e8523b1ebeeb11"],["MrL0ky"],["Eelek","99e474c447484ecd8a1da2f8b86accbe"],["Yaratje"],["Misko_SK"],["gelderland","9ce8419d822b4ad3a47fd08b82d881a6"],["Vilzu01"],["Bl1tzAssass1n","16e90c8255b5453eb686b857bb7d4640"],["Sam_Of_Seagull"],["GrayPluto","e50f0d4dd7a34e8caed8c2e1faf3eec0"],["Crazy_clock"],["Mrchef1423"],["Booorko"],["G1NG3R"],["Rafael_oak","628eec4bc7dd4f6da751de2d3cc3ff62"],["Confusionsy","06e9c47196544468a1994e6eb52143bb"],["kptKoenk","ebe8868fdc1d4b3aa09b840aa0997460"]],"discordLink":"https:\/\/discord.gg\/ekXGedb"},"netherData-url":"uploads\/nether.txt","overworldData-url":"uploads\/data.txt"}
